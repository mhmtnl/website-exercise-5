        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>
        <p>In a parallax scrolling effect, both the foreground and background are moving, but the background typically
            moves much more slowly, giving the illusion of depth. Done correctly, parallax scrolling produces a
            fascinating and seamless virtual experience.

            If you want to add a parallax scrolling effect to your website, you should consider the following tips.

            Use it selectively. Parallax scrolling is much more powerful when you use it on one particular element as
            opposed to all pages and all the time. Use it in headers and titles, or maybe on your home page only. You
            want parallax scrolling to strengthen your website’s design, not distract users.
            Image compression is key. Parallax scrolling uses a variety of media files and CSS shapes to create a sense
            of depth. You don’t want to compromise your web performance and user experience with large image files that
            load too slowly.
            Play with color. Parallax scrolling isn’t just about the images in the foreground and background, but about
            color, too. You might use more desaturated tones in the background and more lively colors in the foreground
            to create an even greater sense of depth.
            Though there are several approaches to achieving a parallax scrolling effect, making the background move
            slower than the foreground is the most popular.
            A slower moving background embodies the same type of feeling as when you are inside a moving vehicle looking
            out: the sky and clouds in the background appear to move at a slower pace than the trees and houses in the
            foreground. Let’s take a look at this effect in play.</p>

            <h2>How to Get The Best Out of Parallax Scrolling</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Now that you have an idea of how to write a parallax scrolling script with CSS, you can start
            experimenting
            with all the design possibilities on your website. Ideally, you'll experiment on a staging site before
            pushing this code to your live website.
            When thinking about how to design your website to take full advantage of parallax scrolling, don't
            forget to
            tell a story, make it engaging, and include a call-to-action.
            Also, don't just use it for the sake of using it! Parallax scrolling is an awesome tool to boost
            engagement,
            but it must be used tactfully for optimal impact.</p>
